<h1 align="center">Hi üëã I'm Joshua Foo</h1>

## üéì About Me:
I'm an aspiring machine learning engineer/data scientist passionate about exploring the realms of coding, machine learning and building robust applications. Fascinated with building applications to improve the lives of others, my personal journey began when I developed an application to automate and streamline course index swapping for students in my university, reducing 40% of manual swapping time for 1000+ students. This first independent project of mine required multiple gruelling weeks of self-learning, testing, and debugging, with a steep learning curve for a complete beginner to full-stack development. However, it sparked a fascination with building products to add value to the lives of others, and having built multiple other web applications, I'm currently learning and implementing a full-stack web application that incorporates ML/AI capabilities.

Currently as a 2nd year student in Nanyang Technological University pursuing a double degree in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence and Accountancy, I believe my strong academic foundations in Data Science & AI coupled with my experience in full-stack web development and an innate hunger to learn and improve the lives of others provide a unique value proposition to any tech-related role and project. My passion for technology pushes me to constantly develop my skillsets and push the boundaries of this constantly-developing industry.

## üöÄ What I'm Up To

- ü§ñ Exploring Machine Learning with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- üíª Building FastAPI applications with ML/AI capabilities
- üí´ Learning Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and DevOps skills and technologies such as CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes, etc.
