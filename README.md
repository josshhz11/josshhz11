- 👋 Hi, My name is Joshua and I am from Singapore
- 👀 I’ve currently finished my first year in Nanyang Technological University studying a double degree in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence and Accountancy, and am currently seeking to learn more about a career in data science, with respect to data science, analysis, engineering, and machine learning.
- 🌱 The programming languages I specialize in are mainly Python, C and SQL, with understanding of the data science methodology (data exploration and analysis, machine learning, etc.) and how to use tools such as Numpy and Pandas to derive insights from data.
- 💞️ I am currently working on learning the entire suite of data tools such as Power BI and Tableau, to better complement my knowledge and skills in data science.  
- 📫 For any queries or interests in collaboration, you can contact me through [email](josshhz11@gmail.com). Let's learn and collaborate together!
