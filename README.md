- 👋 Hi, My name is Joshua and I am from Singapore
- 👀 I’m currently a self-taught programmer before going to university to study a double degree in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence and Accountancy in 2023
- 🌱 The programming languages I specialize in are mainly Python and SQL, with experience in HTML, CSS, JS, C and R.
- 💞️ I’m currently looking to just create new projects that help to automate daily tasks and I hope these projects you find on my profile will help you!
