<h1 align="center">Hi 👋 I'm Joshua Foo</h1>

## 🎓 About Me:
I'm an aspiring machine learning engineer/data scientist passionate about exploring the realms of quantitative analytics, machine learning and building robust applications in finance. Fascinated with building applications to improve the lives of others, my personal journey began when I developed an application to automate and streamline course index swapping for students in my university, reducing 40% of manual swapping time for 1400+ students. This first independent project of mine required multiple gruelling weeks of self-learning, testing, and debugging, with a steep learning curve for a complete beginner to full-stack development. However, it sparked a fascination with building products to add value to the lives of others, and having built multiple other web applications, I'm currently learning and building quantitative analytics models and engines that incorporate ML/AI capabilities.

Currently as an incoming 3rd year student in Nanyang Technological University pursuing a double degree in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence and Accountancy, I believe my strong academic foundations in Data Science & AI coupled with my experience in full-stack web development, fascination with the finance industry, and an innate hunger to learn and improve the lives of others provide a unique value proposition to any tech-related role and project. My passion for technology pushes me to constantly develop my skillsets and push the boundaries of this constantly-developing industry.

## 🚀 What I'm Up To
- 🤖 Building LSTM ML quantitative analytics model
- 💻 Exploring Machine Learning with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- 💫 Learning Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and DevOps skills and technologies such as CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes, etc.
